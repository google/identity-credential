/**
 * Simple persistent storage interface.
 *
 * Data records are organized using tables, keys, and peerIds. Table must be an ASCII string
 * that does not come from an external source (as it is not escaped). It may or may not be
 * case-sensitive. Key is a string that uniquely identifies a record in a table. Additionally,
 * peerId is a string that identifies a "counterpart" entity, i.e. a particular client in the
 * server environment, or a particular server in the client environment. In most cases all
 * three record identifiers must be provided (table, peerId, and the key).
 *
 * Payload of the record is always just a blob of data. Storage does not interpret that data
 * in any way.
