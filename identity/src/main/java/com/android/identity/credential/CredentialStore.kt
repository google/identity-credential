/**
 * Class for storing real-world identity credentials.
 *
 * This class is designed for storing real-world identity credentials such as
 * Mobile Driving Licenses (mDL) as specified in ISO/IEC 18013-5:2021. It is however
 * not tied to that specific credential format and is designed to hold any kind of
 * credential, regardless of format, presentation-, or issuance-protocol used.
 *
 * This code relies on a Secure Area for keys and this dependency is abstracted
 * by the [SecureArea] interface and allows the use of different [SecureArea]
 * implementations for *Authentication Keys*) associated with credentials stored
 * in the Credential Store.
 *
 * It is guaranteed that once a credential is created with [.createCredential],
 * each subsequent call to [.lookupCredential] will return the same
 * [Credential] instance.
 *
 * For more details about credentials stored in a [CredentialStore] see the
 * [Credential] class.
 *
 * @param storageEngine the [StorageEngine] to use for storing/retrieving credentials.
 * @param secureAreaRepository the repository of configured [SecureArea] that can
 * be used.
