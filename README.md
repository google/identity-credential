# Funke EUDI Wallet Prototype

This repository serves as a reference point for code used in the wallet prototype app submitted 
by the "Android German EUDI Open Source Wallet Prototype" team in the
[SPRIND-D Funke competition](https://www.sprind.org/en/challenges/eudi-wallet-prototypes/).

This work is done on a branch of the OpenWallet Foundation's [Identity Credential](https://github.com/openwallet-foundation-labs/identity-credential) (OWF IC)
project with the goal of making sure the delta is as small as possible.
