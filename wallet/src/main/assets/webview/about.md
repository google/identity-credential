Wallet version TODO

This application supports provisioning and presentation of real-world
identity using the ISO/IEC 18013-5:2021 mdoc credential format.

Identity data in this application can be shared in-person to any
ISO/IEC 18013-5:2021 compliant mdoc/mDL reader using NFC or QR
engagement.

Identity data can also be shared to other Android applications or
websites using a preview version of the
[Digital Identities API](https://wicg.github.io/digital-identities/)
API being worked on in the
[W3C WICG Digital Identities group](https://github.com/WICG/digital-identities).
