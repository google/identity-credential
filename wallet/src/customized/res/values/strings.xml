        <h2>Provisioning a Personal ID (PID)</h2>
        <p>In the following screens, information will be collected for provisioning of a PID.</p>
        <p>The PID can either contain hard-coded data for fictional person or
        data derived from the chip in an ePassport or eID document.</p>
        <p>For simplicity, in this version of the Issuing Authority the PID is generated and
        signed on-device however our software stack also supports securely and privately
        conveying the collected evidence to an issuance server for evaluation and signing of the PID.</p>
        <p>The created PID will be bound to this device.</p>
        <p><b>Note to SPRIND Funke EUDI Wallet Jury:</b>This document type is
        included solely as a technology demonstrator of our the OWF Identity Credential project
        provisioning protocol. Please refer to our written report for more information.</p>
