This is a customized flavor of the OWF Identity Credential Wallet specific to the [Funke
competition](https://www.sprind.org/en/challenges/eudi-wallet-prototypes/) and represents the
"Android German EUDI Open Source Wallet Prototype" team's submission.

This application supports provisioning, presentation, and reading
of real-world identity using the ISO/IEC 18013-5:2021 mdoc and
IETF SD-JWT credential formats.

Identity data in this application can shared in-person to any
ISO/IEC 18013-5:2021 compliant mdoc/mDL reader using NFC or QR
engagement. The application also supports reader functionality
for mdoc/mDLs.

Identity data can also be shared to other Android applications or
websites using OpenID4VP and a preview version of the
[Digital Identities API](https://wicg.github.io/digital-identities/)
API being worked on in the
[W3C WICG Digital Identities group](https://github.com/WICG/digital-identities).
